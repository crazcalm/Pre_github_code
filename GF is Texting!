"""
My girlfriend did not have a phone for a while and anytime she would try to contact me, 
she would use facebook are another social network to reach me. I do not check those to often, 
so I would miss a lit of her messages. So I write this code to fix that.

I used the googlevoice api to access my google voice account and let my girlfriend use my phone number to send me
text messages.

The online googlevoice for python 2.7 had an incorrect web link in it that I have replaced. 
I will post that file as well.
